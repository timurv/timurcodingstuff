What an ideal task manager look like for me?

Progress - many task managers make the task disappear once it&rsquo;s done! It doesn&rsquo;t bring any joy.
Multiple buckets for different tasks
Analytics! I do love numbers and would like to see my capacity.
Multi-platform - has a mobile app or is at least adjusted for mobile screens, but has full functionality on desktop
Not too complicated; it should be easy to add tasks
Goals - group tasks for certain goals
*Telegram support - I can just message to add a task

I ended up using Microsoft OneNote as it&rsquo;s multi-platform and allows me to add stuff quickly. I like that I can see the tasks, and when I plan for the next week, I can just copy-paste from the previous one. And because it&rsquo;s free-format, it allows fine-tuning as needed. However, it doesn&rsquo;t have any analytics, and when I set up a system for a week, I have to double-check to see how my weekly tasks align with monthly or yearly goals. Also, at the beginning of the week, I might have one plan, but sometimes the week requires adjustments, and I end up adding more tasks later in the week. It&rsquo;s alright, but the problem is that my original tasks are still there and create a sense of stagnation. Therefore, I don&rsquo;t understand - should I plan better? How much should I reserve for additional tasks? And what&rsquo;s even achievable?"><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://timurvafin.blog/posts/taskmanagers/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.45e028aa8ce0961349adf411b013ee39406be2c0bc80d4ea3fc04555f7f4611a.css integrity="sha256-ReAoqozglhNJrfQRsBPuOUBr4sC8gNTqP8BFVff0YRo=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://timurvafin.blog/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://timurvafin.blog/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://timurvafin.blog/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://timurvafin.blog/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://timurvafin.blog/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://timurvafin.blog/posts/taskmanagers/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://timurvafin.blog/posts/taskmanagers/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Timur Coding Stuff"><meta property="og:title" content="Task managers"><meta property="og:description" content="I like to set up tasks for the week, month, or year, and it really helps to offload thoughts and be more productive.

In my opinion, this shouldn’t even be the case. The initial plan might not be great, so completion to 100% seems unnecessary. On the other hand, low completion is terrible as well. Also, some apps might just flush your data, but that’s a different story…\nBut hey! I’m a developer! I can do stuff on my own! So let’s build one that I would love and learn from. What could go wrong? :)\nDevelopment So the first thing as a developer is to figure out the stack. I cannot develop natively for Apple or Android yet, but I can create a web app. If it’s a web app, what should I use? Frontend - possibly React? It’s in high demand. Backend could be Python. But then - where to deploy and how to authenticate? So I started thinking about the ideal stack.\nIdeal stack After watching a bunch of YouTube videos, I found a way to prototype quickly using https://v0.dev/, brought by Vercel, which allows for quick interface creation. It uses Next JS and Tailwind. Now, I know CSS and have learned a bit of Tailwind, but I’m not too proficient. Here’s where the power of AI came to rescue me - I installed the Cursor editor and went straight into it. Deployed to Vercel, added Clark for easy auth, added a database, done!\nFinal result Just a couple of days in, and my first prototype is up and running at https://www.seikou.work/\n","wordCount":"593","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-03-17T17:23:04+11:00","dateModified":"2025-03-17T17:23:04+11:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://timurvafin.blog/posts/taskmanagers/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Timur Coding Stuff","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://timurvafin.blog/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://timurvafin.blog/ accesskey=h title="Timur Coding Stuff (Alt + H)"><img src=https://timurvafin.blog/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Timur Coding Stuff</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://timurvafin.blog/posts/ title=posts><span>posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://timurvafin.blog/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://timurvafin.blog/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://timurvafin.blog/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Task managers</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-03-17 17:23:04 +1100 +1100'>March 17, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min</div></header><div class=post-content><p>I like to set up tasks for the week, month, or year, and it really helps to offload thoughts and be more productive.
