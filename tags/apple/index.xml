      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love my MacBook Pro mid-2012; it served me well until I bought the one with the M1 chip. I waited for a long time to upgrade because each new line of MacBooks seemed somehow worth it. However, I was really frustrated when Apple decided to solder RAM and then removed the ports, which eventually reached an absolute low point when they introduced the useless Touch Bar, removed USB-A and HDMI ports, had problems with the display cable, and featured an awful keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
