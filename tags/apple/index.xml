      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love my MacBook Pro mid-2012. It served me well until I bought the one with M1 chip. I waited for a long time to updgrade because each new line of the macbooks seemed to be worth somehow. I was really frustrated when Apple decided to solder RAM and then removed the ports until it reached an absolutely trash when they introduced useless touchbar, removed usb-a and hdmi ports, had problems with display cable and an awful keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
